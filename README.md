## Compiling the program

To compile the program run the entertainment_center.py module 
this will write the file kungfu_movies.html and then try to open it in a browser.

## Editing the Movie List

Movie info is also contained in entertainment_center.py 
Each movie has a: movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube, valid_movie_rating
Please note the valid_movie_rating string only accepts "G","PG","PG-13","R" ratings

## Edit CSS

Out of habit I've created a .scss file for easier css modifications
To edit simply compile using codekit, gulp, prepros etc... 
The output css file should be in the css/ folder and named custom.css
